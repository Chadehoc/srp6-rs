# Secure Remote Password (SRP 6 / 6a)

**This is a fork of a fork (<https://github.com/valpaq/srp6-rs>), the original
published repository is (<https://github.com/sassman/srp6-rs>).**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

Implementation of the secure remote password authentication and key-exchange
protocol (SRP version 6a).

The first fork had flaws for use in a real client-server setting:
illogical serialization directions, funny constants for 2048 version,
changes in protocol, big/little-endian errors...

The second fork fixed many things, but remained incomplete and not directly
usable with a true client and server (instead of a simulation in examples).

## About SRP

> The Secure Remote Password protocol performs secure remote authentication of
> short human-memorizable passwords and resists both passive and active network
> attacks. Because SRP offers this unique combination of password security, user
> convenience, and freedom from restrictive licenses, it is the most widely
> standardized protocol of its type, and as a result is being used by
> organizations both large and small, commercial and open-source, to secure
> nearly every type of human-authenticated network traffic on a variety of
> computing platforms.
